This repository showcases SQL queries and supporting scripts developed for an Airline Database Capstone project. The aim of this project is to tackle real-world issues through SQL queries related to seat allocation, flight schedules, and passenger information.

# Project Overview 🪟
The airline database project was part of a capstone course. The primary objective was to craft SQL queries that address business challenges like retrieving booking details, identifying top-paying customers, and more.

# Key Features 🗝️
🛠️ SQL queries addressing various business needs:

📝 Extraction of booking and passenger data

💺 Identification of seat allocations

🏆 Reporting of monthly top-paying passengers

📅 Scheduling of flight and travel details

🏢 Information on airports and aircraft

📑 Comprehensive documentation for each query is available in the docs/ folder.

# Queries ❓
Each SQL query is designed to solve a specific problem statement from the airline database. Here are a few examples:

Query 1: Display the book_date column in yyyy-mmm-dd format from the Bookings table.

Query 2: Retrieve the following columns: ticket_no, boarding_no, seat_number, passenger_id, passenger_name.

Query 3: Find the seat number with the least allocation among all seats.
